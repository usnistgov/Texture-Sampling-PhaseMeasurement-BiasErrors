	abstract = {Crystallographic texture in polycrystalline materials is often developed as preferred orientation distribution of grains during thermo-mechanical processes. Texture dominates many macroscopic physical properties and reﬂects the histories of structural evolution, hence its measurement and control are vital for performance optimisation and deformation history interogation in engineering and geological materials. However, exploitations of texture are hampered by state-of-the-art characterisation techniques, none of which can routinely deliver the desirable non-destructive, volumetric measurements, especially at larger lengthscales. Here we report a direct and general methodology retrieving important lowertruncation-order texture and phase information from acoustic (compressional elastic) wave speed measurements in different directions through the material volume (avoiding the need for forward modelling). We demonstrate its deployment with ultrasound in the laboratory, where the results from seven representative samples are successfully validated against measurements performed using neutron diffraction. The acoustic method we have developed includes both fundamental wave propagation and texture inversion theories which are free from diffraction limits, they are arbitrarily scalable in dimension, and can be rapidly deployed to measure the texture of large objects. This opens up volumetric texture characterisation capabilities in the areas of material science and beyond, for both scientiﬁc and industrial applications.},

	abstract = {Recent studies of additively manufactured (AM) 17-4 stainless steel produced via laser powder bed fusion of nitrogen atomized powders have been found to contain large volume fractions of austenite (γ) compared with the fully martensitic (α′) microstructure of wrought 17-4. These AM 17-4 stainless steels have metastable microstructures that transform from a mixed phase composition to predominantly martensitic during deformation. This transformation process, combined with strong preferred crystallographic orientation (texture) that arises during building, produces complex micromechanical interactions that dictate the macroscopic response. Here, high-energy X-ray diﬀraction performed at a synchrotron light source is used to quantify the volume fraction of austenite and martensite, texture, and the complete orientation dependence of lattice strain (strain pole ﬁgures) at various macroscopic strains levels in-situ during uniaxial tension of AM 17-4. Results from wrought 17-4 are also shown for comparison. Initial martensite volume fraction of the stress-relieved AM specimen was measured to be 0.46 and increased to 0.88 after the application of a macroscopic strain of 0.03. During the transformation process, minimal crystallographic texture evolution was observed in either the γ austenite or α′ martensite. The distribution of strains in the specimen is found to be heavily inﬂuenced by both the transformation process and the initial texture. Phase transformation is found to generate tensile strains perpendicular to the applied load in untransformed γ austenite, while texture is found to produce high heterogeneity of lattice strains within lattice plane families.},
